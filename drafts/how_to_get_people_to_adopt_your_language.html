        <p>I enjoy learning computer languages. Whenever I hear about a new language, I will search about it, read, and try it out. So I am your eager customer.</p>

        <p>So let's say that you have written a new programming language. It is pretty cool. It allows you to be more efficient. It is beautiful. It uses interesting paradigms and patterns. This is the hardest task. You have accomplished it. I am interested now. How do you get me to join your language community? Here is a list of </p>


        <h3>Your Home Page</h3>

        <p>The homepage is a reflection of the language and the community. This will be the most powerful adoption tool. It also helps with a single-entry point that leads to the community.</p> 
        
        <p>What makes a good home page? Having a single sentence describing the language is important. Sometimes adding a short paragraph to expand on the first sentence is good. It is good to have some sample code. Having executable </p>

        <p>The home page is also the gate to the language's documentation. Documentation often reflects the maturity of the language, the quality of the community, and their outlook towards beginners. How beginners are help is important because the friendlier they are to beginners the more enjoyable it will be to work with the language, since at some point we always end up interacting with other people when you do programming.</p>
