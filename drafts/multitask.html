          Understanding multitasking concepts by writing a series of ruby scripts. 
        </p>

        <p>I want to have a better understanding of concurrency. I have read a lot about the subject, but often CS knowledge doesn't solidify unless one implements something in code. Since knowledge solidifies even better when you write about it, I am sharing my experiments and learning through a small number of blog entries.</p>

        <h3>The singletasking vs. multitasking computer</h3>
    
        <p>The simplest computer architecture allows for one program to run at a time. The user has total control over the computer. And this is how the earlier computers were built. Developers use this model when writing codebecause it lends itself for simple solutions that can be easily reasoned.</p>

        <p>Computers were expensive, so having computers waiting around when the code was involved in Input/Output (I/O) was considered a waste. This was particularly important at a time when computing was charged by the instruction executed. So by the 1960s you had groups of people working on creating a multitasking system that would allow programs to use the processor while some time consuming tasks was happening, such as I/O or waiting for user input.</p>

        <p>The most natural solution would be to create a system that could switch between different programs. The computer could execute a few lines of code, and switch to another one and execute a few lines of code for that program as well. Also useful would be to switch to another program while one program was busy with I/O operations. Coming up with this solution would also allow for several users to use the same computer at the same time. Since humans are super slow compared to computers, by quickly switching between programs it could give users the illusion that they were the only users controlling the computer.</p>

        <p>Each of these program running by their own, mostly ignorant of what other processes in the computer were doing, eventually were called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_%28computing%29">process</a>.</p>
        
        <p>So to implement the idea successfully, we need at the very least save the location where each program is located, and make sure that we are not using the memory locations that another program is using to prevent the data being overriden. Providing processes and solving these problems is one of the main tasks of modern operating systems.</p>

        <h3>Modeling a simple process</h3>

        <p> Since I am curious about how to switch programs, I will ignore the memory location problem. I am concerned mainly with How would such a switch between programs would happen, and how do you take into account IO waiting times. I will use Ruby as the language </p>

        <p>The first step is that I am going to simplify what a program is. We know that a program is a series of instructions. I will simply that even more by turning each program into a list of strings.
