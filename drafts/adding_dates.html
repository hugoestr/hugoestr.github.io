I fixed the problem with the lack of dates with my minimal blogging system

        <p>Last week I added an atom feed that is also working as a database of sorts for the minimalistic blogging system. As I was cleaning up, I realized that articles lacked a date and the feed wasn't changing its updated tag. I thought a lot about it, so I decided to spend the afternoon working on this.</p>

        <p>I had not worked on the blogging system the whole week. So I was curious to see how easy it was going to be to change the code. The rake file feels too long. I was ready to battle through my code and discover many faulty pain points.</p>
        <p>I was wrong. Fixing these two date problems ended up taking about 10 minutes. So my feeling that it was going to be painful to work with my code was wrong.</p>
        <p>I am surprised how quickly I am to reaching the point where I will be done. There are two more features that I would like to add. Perhaps I will tackle one of them tomorrow.</p>
