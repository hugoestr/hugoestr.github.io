            Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus</p>

        <p>This is one of the most popular song structures according to Anthony Ceseri's blog post on song structure [1]. You have three musical ideas. The first one leads to the chorus, which is the main musical idea of the song. Then you have a bridge to bring another musical idea and you finish with the chorus. This structure is likely a slight variation of the form below.</p>

        <p>AB<br />
        Verse/Chorus/Verse/Chorus</p>

        <p>This is an older form in Western music. It is common in folk music, and  it has been used in classical leider. This is also binary form in Western classical music [2]. This form itself  is a variation of an even more basic structure.</p> 

        <p>AA...<br />

        <p>This is having a single musical idea that is repeated again and again. This is called strophic form.[3]</p>

        <h3>Thoughts</h3>

        <p>These forms feel very satisfying. There seems to be some connection between counting numbers. You start with one. You then get two, three, and then you keep repeating them.</p>

        <p>I also wonder about human psychology and the existing forms. It seems remarkably small, especially considering how complex classical music can feel. Perhaps there are only a few forms because human minds can only hold so many musical ideas in their mind at once before it gets lost.</p>

        <p>The strophic form also feel like a loop. Considering minimalistic classical music and electronic sampling, it feels both old and modern.</p>
