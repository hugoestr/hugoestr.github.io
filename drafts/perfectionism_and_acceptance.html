        I haven't published that much in a while. That was because my mostly extinguished perfectionistic streak latched onto writing. I look back and I see many articles under the draft folders. Yet I can bring myself to call them finished and push them over to the internet. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Perfectionism is such a nice word because it hides to others and to ourselves what we imagine to be a more unpleasant reality. Perfectionism is anxiety. Anxiety is fear. And fear makes us feel deeply uncomfortable because that is the emotion of danger and physical vulnerability.
        </p>
       
        <p>
        We are afraid that our performance won't be good enough. That others may ridicule our efforts. That our ignorance will be evident to others. That our mistakes will betray our original social class. That our physical or cognitive limitations will be exposed.  That people will reject us because we didn't performed well enough.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our U.S. society dislike people showing fear or weakness. We learn to mask it. We start with calling our fear something else, in this case, perfectionism. Even though it is a paralyzing fear, calling it perfectionism makes it sound like a virtue. It is not that you are afraid that people will reject you because you are not perfect, it is that you demand the best work from yourself and others, always. 
       
        <p>
        Others may settled for playing poorly "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and expect people to applaud. Not you. You are going to play Paganini's Caprice the perfectly the first time you pick the instrument. And when the expected failure at playing the violin happens, remember that we never played it before, we decide that playing the violin is stupid. Or we put off playing for others until we get it right, which often is about one week after never. 
        </p>

        <p>
        We also protect ourselves by being judgmental towards others. We see this in some professional ciricles among software developers. This is probably how we ended up with white board computer science trivia as a way to hire software developers. Or why among some communities there is a culture of endless put downs as the main communication style. Or why we collectively go down into an egineering path that years later we will all agree that it was a mistake, even when many of us thought it was, but we wouldn't dare to say so.  
        </p>

        <p>
        Perfectionism is a common trait, and not a pleasant or productive one. It poisons our souls and sets up bad group dynamics. It is best to work towards extinguishing it from ourselves and from our families, work places, and communities.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is a lot to perfectionism, and it varies from person to person. I am not going to try to pretend to give you a single solution for it, because what works for me may not work for you. I can share what works for me, and you could try it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Acceptance of my fallability is what makes it better for me. Acceptance is tricky because we cannot feign it. There has to be a real emotional acceptance, and since many of us have fought this feeling for a long time, you may be sad. If you fear that imperfect performance may cause people to reject you, then 
       you have to confront that fear. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        Accepting failure is the next step. Most of the time whatever you feared doesn't happen. Most people won't notice mistakes you make when you play music. Most people won't care that your blog has a typo. In most cases, these things are easily fixed. 
        </p>

        <p>
        And that is why I am writing this entry. I know that this piece will fail in some capacity. It will have a number of typos and grammatical mistakes. It may have some weird sentence. It will violate some English usage guidelines.  
        </p>

        <p>
        In reality it doesn't matter. The typos and misspellings can be fixed. Sentences can be rewritten.The uncomfortableness of working through fear is worth the peace brought for acceptance our limitations and the satisfaction of finishing a task.
