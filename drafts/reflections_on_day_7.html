        <p>This is 7 days from the point where I started this music deeper learning. After this week I have learned many details about song structure and some basic techinques on how to put together a song. I feel that I have enough information to move on to practicing. This will be the focus for this week.</p>

        <p>Ideally I would be talking about making a song a day, as in the drawing challenges. The reality is that I am probably not good enough to get a bad song made in that short period of time. What I think is more likely is to try to get a bad song made during the week, with a melody, chord progression, and bassline.  I will probably explore the simpler genres because we must start from somewhere.</p>

        <p>I know it will be bad. Everything we start doing is bad to begin with. And that is okay. It is fun to learn this. It is fun to try to make music. And if what I get out of this exercise is a deeper appreciation of music and the people who make it. </p>
