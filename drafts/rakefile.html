          I added a rakefile to my blog setup to facilitate future tasks.
        </p>

        <p>The next step on my adventure of minimalistic blogging was to add a rakefile to begin organizing and automating some regular tasks. The first task that I added is "publish". The first task that I wrote was to copy the article that is ready to be published as the index.html file. A few days later I added git commands so that it would commit the change automatically.</p>
       
        <p> In the future it may do a number of things, such as generate/add the article in an rss feed and add the last few entries as links in the page. Maybe.</p>
