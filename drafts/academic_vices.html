          <p>I noticed that there are a number of bad habits that one picks in university. We then are released into the world and spread them about. These habits recreate the toxic academic culture in tech culture. Besides of excluding others, they tend to isolate and create anguish in those who practice them.</p>
       
          <p>A lot of this toxic culture is driven by intellectual and professional insecurity. We focus on performing intelligence as a contest. If one is pursuing an academic career, one is almost purshed into this culutre because they are built on getting professors to identify you as being brilliant and promoting you. But definition most of the people who were accepted to a graduate problem are more or less intellectual peers. So it becomes almost natural that some will start trying to shine by putting down others.</p>

          <p> Ideally the point of having an intellectual conversation is to learn from each other. Your interpretation about, let's say, what object oriented programming is about may be different from mine. I may learn from your perspective. You may learn from mine.</p>

          <p>When we are seeped in toxic academic culture the previous description may sound utopic. Yet it isn't. There are people who can communicate like this. What it takes is to focus our communication on listening, understanding, and sharing information. </p>

          <p>Sometimes we are so deep into a toxic culture that we cannot see where it is toxic. I have been there myself. So to be helpful, I am listing some specific behaior. Some can be overlapping.</p>

          <p>Let me repeat the main point: these behaviors happen when we communicate as a performance of our superior intelligence over the inferior intelligence of others. The main tool is shaming others into silence.</p>

          <p>And here are the specific ways how we do this</p>

        <h3>Conversation as debate competitions</h3>
     
        <h4>Description</h4>

        <p>You turn every conversation into a debate competition, whether the others want to or not.</p>
       
      
        <h4>It's function</h4>

        <p>It hijacks whatever communication the other person intended and it now has become an superiority competition. Other modes of communication, emotional bonding, intellectual curiosity, have been aggressively stoped.</p>

        <p>Debates are verbal duels. They are not meant for communication. They are the purest form of performative intelligence. People who do this count on being able to "win." In reality people forced into a debate never change their mind. Communication is effectively over once a debate is on its way.</p>

        <h4>Symptoms</h4>

        <p>You utter the following, "Let me be devil's advocate...". "Actually...". "But..", "But what about...?". Suddenly the other person seems tense and begins using defensive verbal and body language.</p>

        <h4>What to do instead</h4>

        <p>Listen. Be aware that converstions play many roles. Conversations are ways people bond emotional over shared experience. They can be about how someone shares something new that they have learned. Or they can share their life working and opinions. Figure out what the goal of the other person is, and follow along. You will end up with a stronger friendship. Or you can learn a lot. Take advantage of that. </p>

        <p>What if you actually disagree with someone? Pick your battles. If it is trivial, let it go; steer the conversation away from the topic. If they insist on the topic, think of yourself as a reporter interviewing someone. At the very least you will gain insights into how people that you disagree think. If you can stand their ideas, remember that you can end the conversation and walk away.</p>



        <h3>The cool kids club</h3>


        <h4>Description</h4>

        <p>There are two types of people, cool smart people that agree with me, and those disgusting people with inferior intelligence who disagree with me.</p>

        <h4>Function</h4>

        <p>The point is to supress differences in opinion. If the other person disagrees, they are tacitly admitting that they are of inferior intelligence. They are also excluding themselves from the more prestigious in group that was claimed by the debater.</p>

        <p>It also creates a social pressure for people to agree with you. Humans are afraid of being ostracized, so this tactic takes advantage of this fear.</p>

        <h4>Symptoms</h4>

        <p>You say things like, "Only 'insert insult label here' would agree with that." "No self respecting programmer would ...". "Cobol? What kind of people program in Cobol?"  </p>
        
        <p>You have a "humorous" label for certain programmers. Your "humurous" label happens to be sexists or racist. </section>

        <h4>What to do instead</h4>

        <p>Listen.</p>

        <p>If you are about to use labels, don't. If you are creating a "us" vs "them" narrative, stop.</p>

        <p>Recognize that you can be wrong. There are many documented cases of tech leaders advocating a practice only to decry it years later. Every time to supress others sharing their opinions through this tactic is a lost chance of someone helping you out to avoid mistakes or to have a better informed opinion.</p>

        <h3>Verbal put downs</h3>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>You use vocabulary that subtly divides people into the smart people who understand these concepts and the inferior intelligence people who don't.</p>
        

        <h4>Function</h4>

        <p>The first function is that it props up the speaker by making a claim that they understand a topic, let's say, functional programming.</p>

        <p>The second function is that it shames those who don't understand as inferior. It is a subtler version of the cool kids club.</p>

        <h4>Symptoms</h4>

        <p>You say, "Obviously...". "What kind of simpleton doesn't know this?" "How can you not know this?" "Anyone who writes this code should be sued".</p>

        <p>You express fake shock when people don't know some subject. You express disgust when someone admits ignorance.</p>


        <h4>What do do instead</h4>

        <p>Listen</p>

        <p>This one is hard because a lot of formulaic langauge in academia uses these canned expressions. This is a behavior that many professors display day in and day out. You may honestly surprised that others don't know this topic that you find elementary.</p>

        <p>You have to be careful on your canned expressions. You have to be careful with your displays of surprise. If you are surprised, you can be excited that you are about to share some cool information to someone else.</p>

        <p>If you deliberatly do this to put down, people. don't. You may think you are showing strength. You are displaying cruelty. And I have seen many people, myself included, saying something that was objectively wrong. So  you look like a greater fool. And once you have set up the put downs, no one else will come to your rescue.</p>
