        <p>One of the topics driving my dive into learning about music is modular synths. There is this natural overlap of programming and modular synths. Each module is like a library. They have clear input and outputs. And one knows that there are beautiful mathematical transformations happening inside.</p>

        <p>I don't have the money to buy a modular system for what is most likely something I will play with for a short amount of time. Luckly there are a number of software systems that gives us access to being able to explore modular synths without having to buy hardward.</p>

        <p>I am using <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">https://vcvrack.com/</a>. It is free, but you can buy some module if you wish. There are some very good <a href="http://cdm.link/2017/12/step-one-wire-vcv-rack-free-modular-software/">tutorials out there</a>. Nothing can compare to using a physical system, but the software is close enough to get an idea and to learn the concepts. </p>
