          <p class="summary" id="summary">
            Our understanding has limits. We should be aware of them.

        <p>Today we are not used to grappling with our limits and our ignorance. We have grown in a world where the natural assumption is that we know more that humans, as a species, have ever know, and we can control the world through science in technology. Our expectations is that make belief gadgets thought to be a fantasy today should become a reality tomorrow. If we don't know something, we will soon know it. If we can't do something, we will soon be able to do it.</p>
        
        <p>This optimism in ourselves is understandable. If we pick the Englightment as the point where the narrataive that reason and science can help improve humanity, the last 250 years have been an increadible period of succes. Our species went from living more or less the same way they had for 10 thousand years into being able light the darkness, control the invisible forces of electricity and magnetism. We can fly. We can split the atom. We can save our children. We can cure diseases. We have sent rockets to the moon. We have explored the bottom of the oceans. We can talk across continents almost in real time.</p>

        <p>We have been so successful that we are mystified when things don't work out. Not 100 years have passed since the invention of computers. It is common to have a pocket computer that has access to an encyclopedia and world wide communication. We can take a picture of a leaf, and have a model tell us what the species is.</p>

        <p>And the common complaint is that we don't have flying cars.</p>

        <p>It is in this world where "Black Swans" was published over 10 years ago. The author strongly stressed that we can't know everything. We can't predict the future, even when it feels that we get closer and closer to doing so.</p>

        <p>It is a disturbing insight for us. So many of us try to wave it again as yet another fact. Yet if you only absorb it as a fact, you are not fully processing the insight. </p>

        <p>We have facts that are like knowledge, a collection of information. The sky is blue. The ocean has water. There is no emotional element to this.</p>

        <p>and then there are emotional insight. These are stronger. It is difference about knowing that you shouldn't speed because you can get hurt. But you speed because you haven't. Once you get in an accident, you have this visceral knowledge, a strongly emotional one that tells you that it is true.</p>

        <p>The biggest insight from the Black Swan is that our knowledge has a limit. And it does because everything in the world has a limit.</p>
