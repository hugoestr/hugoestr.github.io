        <p class="summary" id="summary">
          When searching for the simplest database technology for my blog, I settled for atom 
        </p>

        <p>The next feature that I wanted to implement was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">rss</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">atom</a>. RSS and atom are a format that allows to communicate with others that you have published a new blog entry. They are both XML documents. I decided to add syndication because this would give a stream view of the site. RSS subscriptions are out of favor today. Yet I like it because it is part of the open web. Unless we use these open standards, there will be no hope in a resurgence of the open web. This is my modest contribution to it.</p>

        <p>I need to hold the information for each article in some handy place so that I can easily query metadata to build a feed and for other tasks. I rejected a sql database immediately. Even <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> is overkill at this point in terms of the greater complexity that it brings into this minimalistic project. The kinds of queries that I forsee needing are simple. I dont need a relational database at this point. Perhaps in the future I will have <em>the need</em> to use sql, but at this point I dont need it.</p>

  <p>I thought that perhaps I could use straight text. I wanted to keep this database as an available file within the site. Potentially people could see it. If they were going to see it, I could use html so that it would look pretty. I began working on the structure, and I realized that I was making my own folk version of an xml document on top of html. So I decided to use xml as the database. I would use atom. The feed would be the database.</p>

  <p> I am new to atom. I began writing atom xml by hand. I used examples from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">rfc 4287</a>. I added the elements that I wanted, and I aggressively used the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi">W3C rss/atom validator</a>. It is amazing how quickly one can learn about a format if one spends about 15 minutes typing markup by hand.</p>

  <p>While writing atom by hand I ran into a problem with the required &lt;id&gt; element. It kept failing validation. I was happy to add ids to it, but I didnt know exactly what it wanted. The RFC said it wanted an IRI. I had no idea what this was, so I learned about it once I found <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987">RFC 3987, International Resource Identifiers (IRI)</a>. It wasnt clear exactly what was it that atom wanted here. After googling a bit and looking at examples, I decided to use urn:uuid IRI, which uses a uuid. I learned how to produce these uuids in ruby ( ruby -e "require securerandom; puts SecureRandom.uuid"), and I was set.</p>

  <p>Writing the code to automate the feed creation ended up being harder than I thought due to the difficulties that I ran into while working with xml and Nokogiri. I had a hard time figuring out how to create new elements and add them to an existing xml document. I eventually solved for problems and integrated the code into the rakefile.</p>
  
  <p>In terms of time, it would probably have been faster to work with sqlite. Yet I did learn more about how to work with xml using Nokogiri. So far I am happy with the results. A single file is working as a database and as a feed.</p>
