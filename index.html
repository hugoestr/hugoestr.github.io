          <p><a href="https://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a> (pd) is a visual musical  programming language that is also a synthesizer. It feels to me like a mixture of Scratch and Lisp. It is a graphic programming language, so you create blocks with objects, numbers, or messages, and you link them with cables. The metaphor is that you are plugging in cables from one module into another. A programming unit is called a patch, keeping up with modular synthesizer metaphor.</p>

          <p>I am using the <a href="http://www.pd-tutorial.com">Pd tutorial</a> as my guide to learning the language. I am about to finish the second chapter, and there is a series of patches that create small but interesting musical outputs.
          </p>

          <p>I hope that learning pd will allow me to explore sound, play with synths without having to buy expensive hardward, and to implement some ideas that I have had about aleatory music.</p>
