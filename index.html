        <p class="summary">
          I added a rakefile to my blog setup to facilitate future tasks.
        </p>

        <p>The next step on my adventure of minimalistic blogging was to add a <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rake">rakefile</a> to begin organizing and automating some regular tasks.  The first task that I added is "publish". The first task that I wrote was to copy the article that is ready to be published as the index.html file. A few days later I added git commands so that it would commit the change automatically.</p>

        <p>Then I reorganized the file structure. So I needed to change the publish task to do more. Now it does some changes to publish it as the index. I also added a draft task, to make life easier. Finally I have added a function that will query the last few articles and add them as links at the bottom of the article.</p>

        <p>In the process I have used <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/">nokogiri</a> and tr. One of the most fun elements of the experiment is that I am actually programming rather than configuring and reading documentation pages.</p>
