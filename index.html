The next step for my static site generator is adding tag pages and links

        <p>I have been adding tags to the entries even if they didnt mean that much at the time. My plan was that eventualyy I was going to get to the point where I would generate pages that collected all articles that shared a tag. So this meant that I had to transform the tag area from plain text to links.</p>

        <p>Last weekend I worked on building the generation of pages. This time I started by writing a class so that an object could handle that. That was a good decision since the class ended up being a lot bigger than I thought it would. This class is executed through a rake task. It worked, but the page looks pretty ugly. I had to decide if I was going to use XML transformations to remove the elements that I didnt like from the template, or if I should create a special template for tags. I decided to create a special template for tags. Thanks to my using an object to create tag pages, all what I had to do to use the new template was to change the template argument when I create that object.</p>

        <p>So this weekend the next step was to write the links. This meant changing a bit how the previous tag functions work. Previously I was writing tags in the body of the article and use that to populate the meta keywords. Since I am going to use links rather than text, this could make this copying harder. So what I decided instead is that meta keywords content will be the source from where the links will be generated.</p>

        <p>Once again it was easy to make the changes. I dont know how long it will stay like this. Probably next week I will clean up the code and create a library to handle XML/HTML and probably another one for git commands. Yet so far I havent run into any painful section of the code, although it does feel a bit hard to find functions in it.</p>
