        <p>Last week I created a ridiculously simple melody while I was playing a drum beat on the drum machine app. It is essentially C played many times in a row ending with a few keystrokes on D and E.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I transcribed the melody into the LMMS, confirmed its structure a bit, and then I grabbed the ukulele to find some simple chords for it. I used the three chord principle as a starting point. The first progression that I got worked, but it was very dull. Then I started to play with some other possible chords to see if I could break up the monotony.</p>

        <p>What I have emotionally learned is how different the same melody can sound with different chord progressions. I knew that this was true in the past. I have even seen some videos where they demonstrate this. Yet there is this thing about doing the work yourself that makes you learn it profoundly.</p>
