          I needed a template. While working on the template, I reviewed semantic sections in HTML 5. 
        </p>

        <section id="content">
        <p> I wrote notes for a technical article that I am writing for the site. I was ready to start writing a cleaner draft, and I ran into my first problem with the minimalismtic website. The issue was that I needed to make a second page that follows the format of the first one. This wasn't that hard to solve. All what I did was to copy the previous entry and clean the content. Whenever I need to create another page, I can jump into the shell and write:

        <code>
            cp template.html &lt;new_page.html&gt;
        </code> 

        That is all what I need to do to solve <em>my current</em> problem. 
        </p>

        <p>While I was making the template, I decided to review the semantic sections that were included in HTML 5 so that I can include those elements. If you recall, HTML 5 included elements such as &lt;article&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;footer&gt;, etc. You can find details about these elements in <a href="&lt;header&gt;">MDN's HTML Elements page</a>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN</a> has an article that describes a use case for these <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Defining_Sections_in_HTML5">html 5 semantic sections</a>
