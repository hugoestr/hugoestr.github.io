        <p>James Hague's blog, <a href="prog21.dadgum.com">"prog21.dadgum.com</a> is one of my favorite programming web sites. It is like a great deli in a corner of a neighborhood: you forget that it exists until you happen to be walking by and you stop to get a great sandwich. Everytime I stumble upon it, I end up hoppoing from page to page for hours. It is probably one of the most readable tech writing on the internet. If you haven't read it, follow the link above and get prepared to be delighted.</p>

        <p>"Programming in the twenty-first century" is one of my models for the current site. It is not a direct inspiration in that I didn't remember it before I started writing this site. Yet I absorbed its simplicity and minimalism. Looking at the site again, keeping in mind my deliberate blogging experiment, I noticed the following features.</p>

        <p><strong>There is no menu</strong>. The best part about this is that one doesn't even miss it or notice it until much later. Content is king on this site.</p>
        <p><strong>There is no stream</strong>. There is no series of articles. There is no calendar organization for this site. It is mainly hypertexted at the end with a list of titles of previous posts. The content of the current page is the focus.</p>


        <p><strong>It is hypertexted</strong> There are semantically appropriate links to other articles.</p>
