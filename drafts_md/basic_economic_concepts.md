## Basic Economic Concepts
###  Study notes

1. People make rational choices when there is scarcity
2. People have preferences
3. Economic exchange is the exercise of these rational preferences 
4. These exchanges happen in markets 
5. Money is the tool for these exchanges 

### Reflection

#### Against

[1,3]. Economics have a simplified model of human psychology. The assumption is that humans are rational. "Rational" is defined as wanting the greatest goods for the least price. Another common way of defining it is that humans are selfish and seeking their best self-interest.

These assumptions were made in the late 18th century in the middle of the enlightmentment. John Stuart Mill complains about how the assumption is incorrect in the 19th century. It is trivial to come up with examples where consumers do not display this kind of behavior.

Selfishness as the basis of human psychology often  denies the existence of altruism. There has been a lot of mental contorsions to explain altruism as some indirect form of selfishness. They find this necessary because altruism often involves someone paying a higher cost for the good of others. This puts the foundation of economics on asshaky ground, if we are too rigid about mapping the model into reality. Luckily most economists seem to understand that the model is a gross simplification. Yet the sketch assumption are helpful to explore and explain many economic behaviors.

One of the weaknesses of economics and economists is that this qualification of the basic principles of economics, that it is rough sketch of human behavior that is useful, is often lost. And the model gets confused by reality. And some economists then demand that the model should be correct even when facing the evidence from the real world.

#### In Favor

[1-5] These basic assumptions are small and easy to understand. They remind one of Euclid's axioms, setting down the foundations of geometry.

And the power of these assumptions to explain so much in the economy feels almost magical.

[4] An unmentioned assumption, which is an important one to bring forward, is that when we are discussing markets we are talking about a population. So even if an individual acts against their own economic interests and buys expensive clothes out of a sense of altruism, his irrational behavior gets cancelled out by the rest of the population participating in the market. 

Economics assumed probabilitistic behaviors of the community before many of the concepts from statistics were developed. So when thinking about economics we should be thinking in terms of communities and their probabilities.

Imagine what would the language of economics would be if it developed when modern statistical tools existed? The English Enlightenment focused on the individual over the community, and economics is within this world. So Adam Smith and the other early economists use the language of individualism to discuss what are population behaviors. Perhaps we wouldn't have terms like "the invisible hand." Maybe we would have called itsomething like "population behavior."

Another positive from these basic assumptions is that it makes it possible for economics to have been studied at all. Otherwise is would be too complex. And even though economics can give us a rough sketch of our economic reality, it is very important to have that sketch rather than have nothing at all.
